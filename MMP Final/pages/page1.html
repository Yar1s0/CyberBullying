        20 year-old girl from USA</h4>
    <p> "I've been bullied on Twitter, by two people in the last couple weeks. I've told them to stop and to leave me alone, but they keep at it.
        After I told them to stop and leave me alone, I stopped communication with them but they still kept tweeting me.
        I feel like I can't say anything with someone on Twitter bullying me. I try to make it look like I don't care and all, but it never seems to work.
        I've reported and blocked them. Anyone have any suggestions please?"

        22 year-old girl from Middletown, NY</h4>
    <p>
        "When I was 15, a freshman in high school, I was bullied over the Internet and at school. I felt like it came out of nowhere.
        One day the group of girls I called friends turned against me viciously over MySpace. They created a fake MySpace profile for me, which contained my cell phone number and instant message name.
        They photo shopped obscene sexual photographs of me and posted them in this profile. I was getting calls and began being stalked by strange men. These girls would make up sexually explicit rumors about me even though at the time I was a virgin.
        They would instant message me and tell me I was going to die. They were going to kill me. I was afraid to leave the house, to have friends, to pick up the phone.
        I lived in fear for so long. I knew they were looking for a fight and I refused to give them one so I deleted all known online presence and changed my number.
        I became recluse, a prisoner in my own home. Once I graduated high school I applied to college outside of my hometown to run away. Now, I am 22 and still have to live with the effects of these cruel girls.
        Trauma is hard to recover from but I know it is possible and I am stronger now than I have ever been. I am not that scared 15-year-old girl but I am still haunted by the girl I used to be."

        Parent of 16 year-old boy from Minnesota</h4>
    <p>
        "My sixteen year old son was cyber bullied on Facebook over a period of 8 hours. The event was so traumatic it caused my son to have an acute psychotic
        break and to be hospitalized in an adolescent psychiatric ward for almost a month.
        He is changed forever and will never be the same mentally. Internet bullying can hurt and affect people and kids need to know this.
        These kids are not being punished in any way and think the incident is funny! We know it is life changing."
